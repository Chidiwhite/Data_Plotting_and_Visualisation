# Data_Plotting_and_Visualisation

1. Bar Chart of Developer Salaries by Age:
  This code creates a bar chart to visualize the annual salaries of Python, Java, and C developers based on their age groups.
  It uses matplotlib to plot the data with different colors for each developer group.
  The x-axis represents different age groups, and the y-axis shows the salary annually (in USD).
  The code includes labels for each developer group and displays a legend to identify them.
2. Counting and Plotting Popular Programming Languages:
  This code reads data from a CSV file containing programming languages used by developers and their counts.
  It uses the 'Counter' class from the 'collections' module to count the occurrences of each language.
  The top 15 most common programming languages and their counts are plotted using a bar chart.
  The x-axis represents the programming languages, and the y-axis shows the number of users for each language.
3. Counting and Plotting Popular Programming Languages (with Pandas):
  This code reads data from a CSV file using pandas and extracts the 'LanguagesWorkedWith' column.
  It uses the 'Counter' class from the 'collections' module to count the occurrences of each programming language.
  The top 15 most common programming languages and their counts are plotted using a horizontal bar chart.
  The y-axis represents the programming languages, and the x-axis shows the number of users for each language.
4. Line Plot of Developer Salaries by Age:
  This code reads data from a CSV file containing information about developer salaries for different age groups.
  It uses matplotlib to plot lines for all developers, Python developers, and JavaScript developers against age.
  The area between Python and JavaScript salaries is filled with different colors based on salary comparisons with a meridian value.
  The plot includes labels for each line and filled areas, and it displays a legend to differentiate them.
5. Histogram of Age Data:
  This code reads data from a CSV file and extracts the 'Age' column.
  It creates a histogram plot to visualize the distribution of ages in specific intervals (bins).
  A vertical line representing the median age is added to the histogram.
  The plot includes a legend to indicate the median age line.
6. Pie Chart of Top Five Programming Languages:
  This code creates a pie chart to visualize the popularity of the top five programming languages.
  It uses the 'explode' parameter to highlight the slices of the pie chart.
  The percentage of each slice is displayed inside the chart using the 'autopct' parameter.
  The chart title indicates that it shows the top five programming languages.
7. Bar and Line Plots of Developer Salaries by Age:
  This code creates bar and line plots to visualize the annual salaries of developers in Python, Java, C, and Perl based on their age groups.
  Bar plots show the salary for each age group, while line plots connect the salary data points.
  The x-axis represents the age, and the y-axis shows the salary annually (in USD).
  The plot includes labels for each line and bar, and it displays a legend to identify them.
8. Stacked Area Plot of Player Performance:
  This code creates a stacked area plot to visualize the performance of three players over time (minutes).
  The area under the plot represents the performance of each player at different time intervals.
  The plot includes a legend to indicate the players' names.
  It uses the 'fivethirtyeight' style for the plot.
